# 100-days-of-code

**Main target:**

- I will code for at least 2 hours every day for the next 100 days.
- Strive to be better today than you were yesterday.

It's a challenge for 100 days to make a habit of everyday coding to develop my skill sets. [Alexander Kallaway](https://github.com/Kallaway)'s #100DaysOfCode challenge inspired me. More details about the challenge can be found here: [100daysofcode.com](http://100daysofcode.com/) or [the official repo](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code).
