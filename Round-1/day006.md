### Today's Progress:

- freeCodeCamp: [Front End Development Libraries](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/)
  - Finished Redux

### Thoughts:

- I need to fix my sleep pattern again. It's fucked up. I slept at 7 am earlier because I got distracted in [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/)'s discord server.
  - uploaded in [#z-midjourney](https://discord.com/channels/757590934828613662/983400299295309884/983400701071867965)
- learning redux is fun.
