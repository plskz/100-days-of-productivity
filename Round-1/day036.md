### Today's Progress:

- made a template for [100-days-of-productivity](https://github.com/Erutidians/100-days-of-productivity) ([#1](https://github.com/Erutidians/100-days-of-productivity/pull/1))
- tried experimenting on [bun](https://github.com/Jarred-Sumner/bun)
- also tried experiment on [gradient-string](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gradient-string) and [figlet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/figlet) thinking of using them for auto-dop but I decided not to use it.
- and I also tried [ttygif](https://github.com/icholy/ttygif) for creating gifs demo for auto-dop documentation but for some reason the generated gifs are not working. :D im lazy to fix it so I'm gonna leave it as it is for now.

### Notes:

- very useful [sindresorhus/awesome-npm](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-npm)

### Thoughts:
