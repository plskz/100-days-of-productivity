## Today's Progress:

- [midjourney/docs](https://github.com/midjourney/docs)
  - format ([#14](https://github.com/midjourney/docs/pull/14))

## Notes:

- I deleted my fork repo of [midjourney/docs](https://github.com/midjourney/docs) and it closed my PR, didn't know that you shouldn't delete your fork if you have an open PR
