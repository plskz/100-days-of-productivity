### Today's Progress:

- freeCodeCamp: [Front End Development Libraries](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/)

  - almost finished at [React](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/#react)

### Notes:

- I saw [bionic reading](https://github.com/ansh/jiffyreader.com) in some random discord server then I decided to try it out and dayuum It's almost as if reading had a 1.5X speed button
