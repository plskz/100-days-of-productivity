## Today's Progress:

- freeCodeCamp: [Front End Development Libraries](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/)
  - Finished React
- relearning python

## Read:

- [Index as a key is an anti-pattern](https://robinpokorny.medium.com/index-as-a-key-is-an-anti-pattern-e0349aece318)

## Thoughts:

- I was relearning python earlier because of commission and found some random complicated problem, I end up not solving both because I was easily distracted experimenting on python shits and also I got bored solving the problem
- relearning python is fun tho I still don't like it
- useless today

## Resources:

- [freeCodeCamp: Front End Development Libraries](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/)
